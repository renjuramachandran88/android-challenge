# Simple App

This folder contains the Android project of the `simple app` required by T-Pro on the second question of the third questions level. The application should show a list of items and make them clickable to reproduce the audio from the URL sent in a JSON file. This JSON file can be obtained via a HTTP GET request to the endpoint https://urvd7g56zh.execute-api.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev. A pause button should also be added.

## Implementation Hints

T-Pro gave the following implementation hints:

* Use the library [Okio](https://square.github.io/okio/) for IO if required;
* For DI on the last project, you can use [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/), [Kodein](https://kodein.org/di/) or [Dagger2](https://dagger.dev/);
* For HTTP, you can use [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) or [retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit).
